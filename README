## Starknet Kit
The Kit comes with Cairo, Starknet, cairo-nile, and protostar already installed.
So you can start Starknet development as soon as you clone this kit!

## Usage
This Kit is DevContainer compatible and can be used in two ways.

### 1. Codespace
After pressing the Use Template button, press open in codespace.
The build will then begin and you will have a complete Starknet development environment in a few minutes!

### 2. Local DevContainer
This method requires Docker and Remote DevContainer extension in the Local environment.

After cloning this template, follow the DevContainer instructions to open it.
After a few minutes, you will have a complete Starknet development environment on your computer!

## Examples
### Starknet Getting Started
The following link will take you to Starknet's Getting Started.
In that case, you can skip the introduction procedure of cairo-lang etc.
https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/getting_started/

### cairo-nile
If you need a local Devnet instead of a testnet, no worries.
Since cairo-nile and its dependencies are all installed, you can start developing nile immediately with the following command.
```bash
cairo init
```

### Protostar
Protostar, one of Starknet's popular development environments, has also been installed.
Let's start development with the following command.
```bash
protostar init starknet
```
